# Deal Prediction Assessment

## Problem Statement  
You are required to build an end-to-end workflow that predicts whether a deal will be won or lost based on sales activities data. The system must analyse patterns in customer interactions and activities to make accurate binary predictions about deal outcomes.

## Given Data  
‚Ä¢ won_deals.json - Successfully closed deals  
‚Ä¢ lost_deals.json - Failed deals  
‚Ä¢ activities.json - All activities associated with deals

### Activity Types  
Each deal has 5 types of activities:  
1. Email - Email communications  
2. Meetings - Scheduled meetings  
3. Tasks - Action items and follow-ups  
4. Notes - Free-form observations  
5. Calls - Phone conversations

## Expected System Capabilities  
The workflow must:  
‚Ä¢ Process and integrate the three JSON datasets  
‚Ä¢ Extract meaningful features from activities data  
‚Ä¢ Train a binary classification model to predict won/lost outcomes  
‚Ä¢ Provide end-to-end prediction capability with innovation in approach

## Technical Requirements

### Data Processing  
‚Ä¢ Load and validate JSON files (won_deals.json, lost_deals.json, activities.json)  
‚Ä¢ Merge deals with their corresponding activities  
‚Ä¢ Handle data cleaning and preprocessing  

### Feature Engineering  
‚Ä¢ Quantitative Features: Activity counts, frequency patterns, timing analysis  
‚Ä¢ Temporal Features: Activity progression over deal lifecycle  

### Machine Learning Model  
‚Ä¢ Implement binary classification for won/lost prediction  
‚Ä¢ Use activities-based features as input  
‚Ä¢ Ensure model interpretability for business insights  

## Innovation Requirements  
‚Ä¢ Creative feature engineering using both structured and unstructured data  
‚Ä¢ End-to-end automated workflow  
‚Ä¢ Unique insights extraction from sales activities

## Core Deliverables  
GitHub Link with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and testing notebooks, Python scripts for data preprocessing and model architecture, the trained model with instructions for loading and inference, a comprehensive README file, and detailed documentation outlining observations, methodologies, performance evaluation, and suggestions for future enhancements.

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline  
‚Ä¢ JSON data loader and validator  
‚Ä¢ Data integration and cleaning modules  
‚Ä¢ Deal-activity mapping system  

### 2. Feature Engineering System  
‚Ä¢ Activity-based feature extraction  
‚Ä¢ Feature selection and optimization  

### 3. Binary Classification Model  
‚Ä¢ Model training pipeline  
‚Ä¢ Won/lost prediction system  
‚Ä¢ Model evaluation and validation  

### 4. End-to-End Workflow  
‚Ä¢ Complete prediction pipeline  
‚Ä¢ Model performance documentation

## Submission  
You should submit a GitHub link of your deliverables.
